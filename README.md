## Description

The Sorting Algorithms Experiment project uses Java to visualize the time it takes to sort arrays consisting of Integers in the range of 0 to 40000 (inclusive). These arrays range in size from 2^2, 2^3, â€¦, to 2^15, with the following properties:
* Random elements (using java.util.Random)
* First 50% sorted (using java.util.Arrays.sort())
* First 75% sorted
* 100% sorted
* 100% sorted, descending

It tests the following algorithms:
* Bubble Sort
* Bucket Sort
* Counting Sort
* Heap Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort (first element as pivot)
* Quick Sort (median of threes pivot)
* Quick Sort (random element as pivot)
* Radix Sort
* Selection Sort
* Shell Sort

The experiment creates CSV and chart data showing the time in microseconds for each array size. These files are created for each sorting algorithm and array group combination.

## Running the Experiment

### Quick Start
- Clone the project
- Open the project folder in IntelliJ IDEA
- Navigate to /main/java/Main
- Click Run -> Run 'Main'

### Data Output
The experiment driver is contained under ./main/java/Main.java. Running this driver creates directories ./experiment-results/data/, which contains timestamped CSV files labeled with the sorting algorithm used and the type of array performed on by the algorithm, and ./experiment-results/charts/, which contains visualizations of the data, also timestamped and labeled.

Visualizations are created using the [JFreeChart and JCommon](https://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/download.html) libraries, which are already downloaded into the /libs folder. If you are not using IntelliJ, make sure to add the /libs folder to your project.

## Development Environment

- Coded using:
  - IntelliJ IDEA 2024.2.2
  - IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate Edition) 2023.3.5
- Unit testing conducted in JUnit 5.8.1.
- Complies with [Google Java Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format).
